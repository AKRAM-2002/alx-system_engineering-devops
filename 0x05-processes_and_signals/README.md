# Processes and Signals Project

## Overview

This project focuses on processes and signals in a Linux environment, emphasizing understanding of PID, processes, signals, and bash scripting.

## Learning Objectives

- Grasp concepts such as PID, processes, and signals.
- Learn essential Linux commands (ps, pgrep, pkill, kill, exit, trap).
- Develop bash scripts for process management.

## Important Tasks

### 0. What is my PID

Create a Bash script (`0-what-is-my-pid`) that displays its own PID.

### 1. List your processes

Develop a Bash script (`1-list_your_processes`) to display a user-oriented list of running processes.

### 2. Show your Bash PID

Write a Bash script (`2-show_your_bash_pid`) to display lines containing the word 'bash' and show the PID.

### 3. Show your Bash PID made easy

Create a Bash script (`3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy`) to display PID and process name for processes containing 'bash'.

### 4. To infinity and beyond

Write a Bash script (`4-to_infinity_and_beyond`) that displays "To infinity and beyond" indefinitely.

### 5. Don't stop me now!

Develop a Bash script (`5-dont_stop_me_now`) to stop the process from task 4 using the `kill` command.

### 6. Stop me if you can

Create a Bash script (`6-stop_me_if_you_can`) to stop the process from task 4 without using `kill` or `killall`.

### 7. Highlander

Write a Bash script (`7-highlander`) that displays "To infinity and beyond" and "I am invincible!!!" on signals.

### 8. Beheaded process

Develop a Bash script (`8-beheaded_process`) to kill the process from task 7.

### 9. Process and PID file

Create a Bash script (`100-process_and_pid_file`) that creates a PID file, displays messages, and deletes the PID file on termination.

### 10. Manage my process

Write a Bash script (`101-manage_my_process`) to manage the execution of another script (`manage_my_process`) with start, stop, and restart options.

### 11. Zombie

Develop a C program (`102-zombie.c`) that creates five zombie processes and displays their PIDs.
